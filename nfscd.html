                        <p>I first played this game couple weeks ago, and it absolutely blew me back. Night in the Woods is an absolutely delightful game with amazing characters, writing, humor, story and music.</p>
                        <p>Night in the Woods is about a college student called Mae Borowski dropping out of college and returning back home to her hometown of Possum Springs (a town based on the Rust Belt towns of America). However her return home is abruptley disturbed by the mysterious dissapearance of one of her friends, and the discovery of a severed arm...</p>

                                <p>Loves playing her bass and smashing things with her baseball bat.</p>
                                <p>She dropped out of college and returned home to her parents, though she doesn't wanna talk about <em>why</em> she dropped out.</p>

                                <p>Even though he doesn't talk about it much, he didn't have the best childhood. From a neglectful father to an abusive mother, Angus had a rough time home until he was saved by Gregg.</p>

                        <p>The writing in this game is just absolutely phenomenal. Despite the fact that the cast isn't 'human', all the characters in this game <strong>feel</strong> like actual real people. The way the characters interact and talk just feels so natural. Mae Borowski is probably also my all-time favorite protagonist in any game I've played, just due to how relatable her awkward and impulsive behavior she has.</p>

                        <p>Also the music in this game is fantastic, I've been listening to it for weeks since I played the game. From the calm songs that plays in Possum Springs... </p>
