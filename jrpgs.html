                <h1>Japanese RPGs</h1>
                <p>The RPG genre has its roots in Japan, where games such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest massively influenced games and the RPG genre. Japan also has a lot of wacky and weird RPGs which influenced the creation of many more wacky and weird RPGs in later years.</p>

                        <h2>Earthbound</h2>
                        <hr>

                        <p><q><em><u>This game stinks!</u></em></q></p>
                        <p>Despite this game's <em>questionable</em> tagline of 'This game stinks!', the game is one of the most beloved and classic cult games of all time. The game was made by Nintendo, and spearheaded by the briliant Shigesato Itoi, Japanese celebrity and essayist. Whilst initially doing quite poorly upon its release in 1994, the game became an absolute classic when people started playing the game years later.</p>
                        <p>Unlike most RPGs coming before it, Earthbound is not set in some fantasy world with dragons and knights. Instead, Earthbound is set in a satirical version of 90's America called 'Eagleland', a place where violent hippies and 'out of control' taxi's as enemies aren't out of place. The game trades out common RPG tropes like health potions to recover HP with hamburgers and fries, and magical abilities with that of psychic abilities.</p>
                        <p>You play as Ness, an average baseball-cap wearing kid with psychich powers, as he is tasked by an alien insect to bring an end to invasion of the alien 'Giygas'. Along the way meeting other kids who join you along the way, and connect with the sanctuaries of the world to realize the full power of the Earth.</p>

                        <p>The original western release of Earthbound in 1994 also came with an amazing game manual, filled handy tips and with adorable paper mache models of the cast and other characters. Along with quaint in-universe travel ads and news paper articles. Years later when Earthbound got re-released on the Wii-U Nintendo made the strategy guide available online, which you can check out <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAJE.pdf">here.</a></p>

                        <p>The game's unique suburban rpg setting and humoristic tone inspired many future games, such as Undertale, Omori, Lisa, South Park: The Stick of Truth and a whole bunch more.</p>
                        <p><u>Earthbound and its prequel Earthbound Beginnings are available on the Switch Online Apps.</u></p>

                        <img class="framedpicture" src="images/yumenikki/yumebanner.jpg" alt="Banner picture for Yume Nikki"/>
                        <p>In Yume Nikki you play as a secluded girl named Madotsuki, and traverse strange, surreal and nightmarish dreamworlds in her sleep. Along the way finding 'Effects' which allows you to either change your appearance or do an action, when you find all of them you might even unlock an ending...</p>
                        <p>The game is quite mysterious in nature, as practically everything that happens in the game goes without explanation. A lot of the characters in the game have fan given names due to them not being named otherwise, and a lot of what we assume is the plot is mostly just theories. Even the author is quite the mysterious type. The only thing we know about them is that they call themselves 'KIKIYAMA', remaining completely anonymous and never giving any interviews (until Toby Fox, creator of Undertale, got an exclusive interview with them. Which even then mostly consisted of 'yes or no' answers and one question about what they'd wanna order from the Denny's menu. Which they answered with 'Rice Casserole with 3 Types of Cheese & Shrimp')</p>
                        <p>One of the most well known things about Yume Nikki is the secret of Uboa. In the area known as 'The Pink Sea' you can find a house with a girl inside, and by inspecting the light switch you can turn off the light in the house. If you go back outside and back in and turn of the light again, you have a chance (1/64) to meet Uboa. When you hit that chance, the girl in the house is replaced by Uboa, a scary grimacing white-faced being. Touching it sends Madotsuki to a hellish world where the only method to escape is by waking up.</p>

                        <h2>Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</h2>

                        <img class="framedpicture" src="images/moon/moonbanner.jpg" alt="Banner picture for Moon"/>
                        <p><q><em><u>Don't be a hero. Experience the love. Experience moon.</u></em></q></p>
                        <p>Often credited as one of the first 'anti-rpgs', Moon is a Japanese RPG that breaks common RPG conventions by going against the architypical 'kill every monster you come across' style of RPG goals. Instead, Moon is about love and saving the souls of enemies.</p>
                        <p>For years this game wasn't available in the west due to the English translation being seemingly cancelled for no reason whilst it was being developed. However years later Toby Fox, creator of hit RPG 'Undertale' (which was inspired by the concept of Moon, but Toby hadn't actually played it due to not being translated in English), convinced Moon's designer, Yoshiro Kimura, to consider making an English translation for the game. In 2020, 23 years after the original release, people in the west were finally able to officially play this game in English.</p>
