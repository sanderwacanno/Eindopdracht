                <p class="introtext">RPG Maker is a series of RPG Game Engies made by the Japanese company Enterbrain. Due to the software being easy to use for everybody, many people have made some truly wacky games with it. Whilst some of the games on the previous were also made in RPG Maker, this page more so focuses on Freeware RPG Maker games you can download for free.</p>

                        <!-- Banner is from the Wiki article about OFF -->
                        <p></p>
                        <q><em><u>Caution - Certain scenes in this game could be immensely shocking to an unwarned public. Or not...</u></em></q>

                        <p>OFF is a Belgian RPG Maker game developed by Mortis Ghost, and music composed by Alias Conrad Coldwood.</p>
                        <p>An absolute cult classic RPG, OFF follows the player controlling an entity called the 'Batter' as he sets out on his mission to 'purify' the land. 
                            You traverse the several Zones the land is divided in, meeting the strange inhabitants and combating the weird and terrifying spectral enemies.</p>

                        <p>The game plays generally similar to other RPGs combat-wise, however it does trade in the generic RPG element system (fire, ice, lightning, etc.) for a quite unconventional one. 
                            OFF instead uses the elements of smoke, metal, plastic, meat and sugar for several attacks and enemy weaknesses.</p>
                        <p>Whilst the overworld graphics is generally displayed in simple 8 bit pixel art, the battles however feature absolutely striking gnarly artwork. The way these spectral creatures are drawn with such striking linework and monochrome colors give the game a truly unique style.</p>

                        <p>The soundtrack by Alias Conrad Coldwood features a lot of ambient, surreal and creepy songs that give the game a very destinct mood. Of course, with the exceptions. Like the game's most popular song, Pepper Steak, a foxtrot and ragtime inspired song that plays when fighting regular enemies.</p>

                        <p>Franken is a parody RPG (made by Samanthuel "splendidland" Gillson) based on games such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. The game stars out as a generic plot of a hero defeating monsters and fighting a big bad evil, and somehow spirals into a pretty interesting story. The game heavily subverts and plays with established tropes to make a short yet really fun experience, only needing an hour or so to beat it.</p>

                        <p>The music in this game originate from loads of different sources. From Gundam and Space Battle Ship Yamato, to Blake 7 and Space 1999. This creates an interesting dissonance between the game being distinctly classic rpg looking, whilst the music is distinctly not video game-y at all.</p>
                        <p>(When making this page I didn't actually realize this game wasn't actually made in RPG Maker, rather it is made using the Official Hamster Republic Role Playing Game Construction Engine (OHRRPGCE OHR))</p>
