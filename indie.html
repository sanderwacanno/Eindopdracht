                <h1>Indie Games</h1>
                <p>Many indie game (games that are independantly developed, and not by major studios) developers were inspired by games such as Earthbound or other JRPGs, and therefore made games influenced by them.</p>

                        <h2>Undertale</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <img class="framedpicture" src="images/undertale-deltarune/undertalebanner.jpg" alt="Banner picture for Undertale">
                        <p>Undertale has it all. A pixelated art-style, humoristic and quirky dialogue, a cast of colorful characters, a post-modernist and meta approach to storytelling, and an absolutely banger soundtrack.</p>
                        <p>Published in 2015, Undertale is the brainchild of composer Toby Fox. Heavily inspired by Earthbound and the main concept of Moon RPG, Undertale is an RPG where you don't have to kill anyone, instead it allows you to be a true pacifist and befriend your enemies instead. (That however doesn't mean you <em>can't</em> kill enemies.)</p>
                        <p>Undertale takes place in 'the Underground', a giant cave system underneath the mountain 'Ebot'. Many years before the beginning of the game a war happened between humans and monsters, and after humans defeating them, the humans imprisoned the monsters there. Many many years later a human child falls down a cave on Mt Ebot into the Underground. As the child you have to traverse the Underground, meeting (and fighting) loads of colorful monster characters, and go through the barrier that imprisons everyone stuck in the Underground. However, the monsters also want to escape the Underground, which they only need one thing for to shatter the barrier keeping them trapped; the <em>Soul</em> of a <em>human being!</em></p>

                        <p>Undertale also features a very unique battle system. Undertale is instead a turn-based bullet hell where the player has to dodge enemy projectiles themselves, instead of being a luck-based system like most RPG's. This makes each enemy encounter feel unique because each of them use new and unique battle attacks that you have to dodge.</p>
                        <img id="bullethell" src="images/undertale-deltarune/bullethell.gif" alt="A gif showing Undertale's battle system.">
                        <p>Since Toby Fox is a composer, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Featuring amazing 8-bit and 16-bit-styled video game tracks, the unique battle themes for the various bosses you fight through the game being a particular stand out amongst the soundtrack. (and since I can't choose a song to represent the entire soundtrack, here is just the entire soundtrack in full. Its totally worth it to listen to).</p>

                        <p>A darkly comedic and depressing game, Lisa: The Painful is set in a post-apocalyptic world. You play as Bradley 'Brad' Armstrong, a deeply broken man who finds salvation in <em>trying</em> to take care of a girl he found in the middle of the desert.</p>
                        <p>After she's suddenly gone, Brad travels the wastelands in search of her. Meeting strange people along the way that you can potentially ally yourself with (and who can also potentially die if Brad isn't careful enough).</p>

                        <p>This game is pretty much the epitome of surreal, from the strange visual style to the nonsensical gibberish that characters speak. This game is... strange, but also very interesting!</p>
                        <p>The game centers around Wayne, a leather-wearing man with a crescent for a head, as he goes on a journey to defeat Gibby, king of the Moon. However, trying to understand the plot more than that can be kinda difficult, due to much of the dialogue being randomly generated to give the game its strange unnatural vibe.</p>
                        <p>The visuals in the game where made using clay models that the creator digitally scanned and turned into sprites for the game, giving it a surreal and otherwordly stop motion-looking style.</p>

                        <h2>YIIK: A Post Modern RPG</h2>
                        <hr>
                        <img class="framedpicture" src="images/yiik/yiikbanner.jpg" alt="Banner picture for YIIK">
                        <p>When talking about good RPG games, you also gotta talk about the YIIK...</p>
                        <p>'YIIK: A Post Modern RPG' follows the story of Alex Eagleston, a smug overly pompous liberal arts major, who returns home after graduating. After meeting a strange woma, and subsequently watching her be obducted by unearthly beings inside an elevator, Alex becomes obsessed with the mystery surrounding and finding this woman again.</p>
                        <p>YIIK is not a good game, calling it flawed is putting it mildly. So here is a short list of some of the major points people have problems with with this game:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alex is a jerk ass protagonist that's supposed to learn and become a better person, but ultimately he doesn't.</li>
                            <li>The game is weirdly anachronistic. Despite being set in the 90's, it will reference culture from far ahead of its time, and refer to games that only came out several years before with as classics.</li>
                            <li>The major plot point about a woman being kidnapped stems from one of the creators own obsession with a real life death of a woman, which is pretty insensitive to use as an inspiration for a video game.</li>
                            <li>Alex talks to himself a lot through out the game, and he'll do this in agonizingly longwinded paragraphs of rambling. (Which they addressed in an update which allows you to reduce Alex's monologing with a setting.) </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite that, the game is still kinda interesting. From the unused endings to just trying to figure out what was the though process behind some of the game development decisions.</p>
                        <p>I highly recommend watching Tehsnakerer's video on YIIK, where he desperately tries to find a shred of meaning in this game.</p>
